# Minimal full JavaScript web application example
Minimal example of how to send data content from a client side file upload to a server via HTTP and save it to file.

## Set up
```
git clone https://github.com/bene200/mini-express-example.git
cd mini-express-example
npm install
```
Run the app
```
npm start
```
develop
```
npm run develop
```

## What is what
Starting point of the application is index.js. Server logic is in 'server'. Client side logic is in 'public'. The 'uploads' folder is where the data uploaded on client side is saved on the server side. I added many comments to explain the logic of every file.
